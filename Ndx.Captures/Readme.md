# NDX Capture
NDX Capture library provides classes that allow reading different type of PCAP Files.

| Class | Description  |
| ----- | ------------ |
| PcapFile | Provides static methods for the creation and opening of Pcap files and provides IObservable interface to these files. |
| LibPcapStream | Implements the read access to Libpcap file format.  |
| PcapNetmonStream | Implements the read access to the native file format of Microsoft Network Monitor 3.x. |
| PcapNgStream | Implements the read access to PCAP-NG file format. |
| PcapJsonStream | Can read JSON file generated by `tshakr -T ek` command. |

## Usage
The simplest possible way of usage this library is to read all frames from 
a supported pcap file and print them on the standard output:

```csharp
IObservable<Frame> frames = PcapFile.ReadFile(@"input.pcap");
frames.ForEachAsync(Console.WriteLine);
```

Method `ReadFile` returns observable that can be used aslo with LINQ:

```csharp
PcapFile.ReadFile(@"input.pcap").Where(x=>x.FrameLength > 100).ForEachAsync(Console.WriteLine);
```
This snippet prints only frames that are larger than 100 bytes.

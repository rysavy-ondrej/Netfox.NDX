  title: LwM2M TLV Data Format
  endian: be
  file-extension: application/vnd.oma.lwm2m+tlv
doc: >
    The binary TLV (Type-Length-Value) format is used to represent an array of values 
    or a singular value using a compact binary representation, which is easy to process 
    on simple embedded devices. The format has a minimum overhead per value of just 2 bytes 
    and a maximum overhead of 5 bytes depending on the type of Identifier and length of the value. 
    The maximum size of an Object Instance or Resource in this format is 16.7 MB. 
    The format is self- describing, thus a parser can skip TLVs for which the Resource is not known.
    This data format has a Media Type of application/vnd.oma.lwm2m+tlv.
